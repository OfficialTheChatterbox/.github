## The Chatterbox Social Media

<b>About us:</b> The Chatterbox was founded by Shedeur B because they just learned NodeJs and wanted to do stuff. <br>
<b>What we do:</b> We make connecting with each other easier by being the middle-man. <br>
<b>Why open source:</b> We believe in a free web. We want everyone to be able to borrow code for their issues. We believe that open-source is the biggest form of trust you can have with a big company. <br><br>
